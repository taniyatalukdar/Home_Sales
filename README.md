This project helps determine the key metrics about home sales data using PySpark and Spark SQL on Google Colab. Temporary views were created and tables were cached and uncached using Spark. 
Some of the questions that were answered include:
   - What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
